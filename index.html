      <p>Ferrets make wonderful companions, however they may not be the best pet for everyone. Here are a few things to consider before even thinking about getting a ferret.</p>

        There are different regulations depending on your country, state, or city concerning the legality of owning a ferret. Information regarding your area's regulations can be found through your local Human Society or a veterinarian.

        While ferrets themselves are expensive to purchase, upkeep and care will be an ongoing cost as well. Money must be spent routinely on vaccinations which can be from $150 to $350. Along with veterinary care ferrets require a good diet, deodorizing cleaners, vitamin supplements, shampoos, and of course any extra expenses such as collars and toys.

        Most domestic ferrets are not inherently aggressive, however ferrets are hunters by nature. They must be taught proper behavior such as not to nip or bite. You must put in the time and energy in order to have a responsive, well mannered pet. Training can be rewarding, as ferrets can be litter trained as well as learn a few tricks.

        As stated before, ferrets are instinctual hunters. They will not do well around animals such as birds, fish, rodents, or lizards. Ferrets are also not advised to be around small children without supervision. As they like to dig and chew, electrical cords and furniture must be protected or removed from the ferrets.
